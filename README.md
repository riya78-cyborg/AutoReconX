# AutoReconX
AutoReconX is a powerful Bash-based automation framework designed to streamline and scale your bug bounty recon and exploitation workflow. Rather than replacing manual testing, AutoReconX supercharges your initial reconnaissance, collecting valuable intel and reducing noise so you can focus on what's critical  exploitation and reporting.
